  <p>
    I am a student at Ohio University pursuing a bachelor’s degree in computer science. The curriculum is composed of primarily computer science and electrical engineering courses with additional requirements in science, mathematics, and general education. I will be graduating, with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, on December 12, 2015. In addition, I work part-time as a web developer in the Custom Applications Department. The Department is responsible for developing web application for clients affiliated with the University. The majority of my work focuses on front-end development and user experience.

    In my leisure I enjoy playing intramural soccer. Formations are nonexistent in recreational leagues, but I often find myself playing a wingback position. In addition, I recently purchased a keyboard and started practicing the piano. Full disclosure, I am an awful musician, however; I am making noticeable improvement. Music is something I am passionate about and my goal is, one day, to be a mediocre pianist. Furthermore, I really like cars. To be honest though, I know almost nothing about cars. As a kid, I enjoyed taking apart bicycles and swapping their parts to make custom rides. When I can afford it, I would like to acquire a quality tool collection and learn to do my own services and repairs. Currently, I drive a five-speed 2004 Jaguar X-Type. Even though it is starting to fall apart, I love this car. I think every man’s one true love is his first car.
