  <div class="heading">About Me</div>
  <p>My Name is Daniel Nagy. I'm a senior software engineer at Ohio University. I think of writing software as both a mathematical and artistic discipline. I have an obsession with beauty and symmetry. My creative mentality makes me somewhat unique in the field of computer science. I believe the success of most software is directly related to the user's experience. That's what software should be in my opinion, an experience, something that is both visually and emotionally stimulating.</p>

  <div class="heading">What Framework Are You Using?</div>
  <p>I am using a combination of AngularJS and my own interpretation of Material Design. I'm a huge fan of what Google is doing, both with Angular and Material Design. I've been following the specifications from their official documentation which can be found <a no-ink href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
  
  <h4>Why not use Angular Material?</h4>
  
  <p>I'm using <a no-ink href="https://github.com/angular/material" target="_blank">Angular Material</a> for other projects I'm working on however my experience with it so far hasn't been the best. I'm excited for it to do a little more maturing though.</p>
    
  <p>In addition, I wanted to challenge my creative abilities. I enjoy writing my own code because I can make it behave exactly how I want.</p>
