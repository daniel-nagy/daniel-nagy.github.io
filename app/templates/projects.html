  <div class="heading">iCarrier</div>
  <p>The iPhone might honestly be the reason why I chose to be a computer science major. My first iPhone was the 3GS. I became obsessed with Jailbreaking and playing with the interface and system sounds. At the time I knew nothing about computers and reading code was like trying to read a foreign language. I give myself admiration for being able to write a piece of JavaScript that could make an Ajax request to Yahoo's weather API and then parse the JSON response having, admittedly, no idea what the hell I was doing.</p>
  <p>I always wanted to write my own iPhone tweak and have it available in the Cydia store for all to enjoy but at the time I didn't have the programming knowledge to make it happen. After My first year of college, and some coding experience, I decided that I was finally going to make it happen. The result was iCarrier. Unfortunately it's not available in the Cydia store. I made a request but was denied because it was too similar to other tweaks already available. However you can still check it out on my GitHub profile. iCarrier was a fun little tweak, I still use it today.</p>

  <div class="heading">My Album Collection</div>
  <p>My Album Collection is a project I did when I was first hired as an intern by the University to build custom web applications. I was still pretty new to web development and it was my first experience with AngularJS. I chose to do an album collection because I knew I could do some neat things visually with artists, genres, album artwork etc. I put together most of the UI using Twitter's Bootstrap. Source code for my album collection can be found on my GitHub profile.</p>

  <div class="heading">Ohio UI</div>
  <p>Ohio UI is an interface library I developed for the University's custom applications department. The goal of Ohio UI is to provide an API for reusable interface components that is injectable into many applications. The benefits of this include: less duplication of code, faster client side development, consistency across multiple applications, and so on. Unfortunately I'm just one man and cross-browser compatibility became a nightmare, I'm looking at you Internet Explorer. Ohio UI is still in production and some of the full time developers have contributed to the project. Recently my boss and I have come to an agreement that we like Material Design and are considering officially adopting Angular Material as our interface library. I can't reveal any code for Ohio UI because it is intellectual property of Ohio University.</p>

  <div class="heading">Material Design</div>
  <p>I've been experimenting with creating my own material design components. This blog is a display of that effort. I'm creating and extending features as I need. I don't know how far I'll take this project. If it continues to grow, or if anyone is interested in using or contributing to my code, I'll put together an official project and make it installable using bower. You can view the source code for this bog on my GitHub profile.</p>
