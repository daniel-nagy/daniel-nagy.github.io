  <div class="heading">About Me</div>
  <p>My Name is Daniel Nagy. I'm a software engineer at Ohio University. I think of writing software as both a mathematical and artistic discipline. I have an obsession with beauty and symmetry. My creative mentality makes me somewhat unique in the field of computer science. I believe the success of most software is directly related to user experience. In my opinion software should be something that is both visually and emotionally stimulating.</p>

  <div class="heading">What Framework Are You Using?</div>
  <p>I am using a combination of AngularJS and my own Material Design creations. I'm a fan of Google's Material Design. I've been following the specifications from their official documentation which can be found <a no-ink href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
  
  <h4>Why not use Angular Material?</h4>
  
  <p>I'm using <a no-ink href="https://github.com/angular/material" target="_blank">Angular Material</a> for other projects I'm working on however my experience with it so far hasn't been the best. I'm excited to see it mature though.</p>

  <p>The media player is a work in progress so it may be a little buggy. For now you can restart a track by clicking on it from within the track listing.</p>
  
  <p>Every week I'm going to try to feature a new album with some of my favorite tracks so make sure you're keeping up! This weeks album is TALKING IS HARD by WALK THE MOON. I'm not in love with this album but there are a few songs I really like. Listen for the octaves in base clef in Portugal, Sidekick is about hooking up with your best friend and Avalanche is a neat song about feeling like you met someone in a past life. Check it out on <a no-ink href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/talking-is-hard/id936832274" target="_blank">iTunes.</a></p>
